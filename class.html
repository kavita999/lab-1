<h2> C PROGRAMMING <h2>
<p align="center"><font color="pink"> I expect my teacher to provide me with the opportunity to learn and understand the concepts in this course in a way that I can understand and give adequate feedback on my abilities, in order that I can apply this knowledge and achieve my goal. <br>It  will help me to understand how acomputer work.<br> Almost all other programming languages can interface with it.<br> It will be easier to learn than other programming language</p>
<br/> <br/>
<h3> <font color="green">COMPUTER ORGANISATION AND ARCHITECTURE</font> <h3>
<p alin="center">By understanding computer architecture I basically understand how everything is linked together, how a computer works and how come a program really does work. <br> I see the big picture. Without computer architecture you cannot truly understand: ... assembly programming 
<br>Computer architectures represent the means of interconnectivity for a computer's hardware components as well as the mode of data transfer and processing exhibited. <br>Different computer architecture configurations have been developed to speed up the movement of data, allowing for increased data processing</P>
<h4> <font color="green"> OPERATING SYSTEM </font></h4>
<p align="center"> OS will help me become a better coder</p>
<h5> <font color="green">DISCRETE MATHEMATICS</font> <h5>
<p align="center"><font size="5"> Sound Knowledge of Mathematics. Every great math teacher has an extensive understanding of mathematics.<br> Successful math teachers do not force students to follow their approach.Good Motivator. Great math teachers know that students have different interests,Constantly Learning,Caring<br>A math teacher is someone who inspires their students to look beyond the pages of the textbook to become problem solvers and critical thinkers. ... We share common goals and are here to support your journey as a mathematics educator.</font></p>
 <h6> <font color="green"> DATA STRUCTURE</FONT>
<p align="center"> <font size="5">It will help me to become better at competetive programming </font></p>
